/**
 * P2-04 — a sub-agent run's OWN tool surface, and the per-conversation record of it.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * Until P2-04 a sub-agent conversation was created straight from its parent's assistant
 * (`SubAgentEngine.executeRun`: `Conversation.ofId(assistantId = parentAsstUuid)`), so the child's
 * surface was the parent's surface — "子 ⊆ 父". That is wrong in both directions:
 *
 *  - a specialist sub-agent often needs a tool the parent deliberately keeps off its own surface
 *    (a narrow child is the whole point of dispatching one), and
 *  - the only thing that should actually constrain a child is the headless **floor**
 *    ([SubAgentToolSurface]), because a headless run cannot ask the user anything — not an
 *    accident of which assistant happened to be the parent.
 *
 * [resolveChildAssistant] turns a [SubAgentProfile]'s own surface fields into a *derived* assistant
 * (parent + the three overridden tool fields), which is the one thing [ChatService]'s tool
 * assembly needs to build the child's list. Everything else the run needs — model, system prompt,
 * memories, compaction, permissions — keeps coming from the parent, exactly as before.
 *
 * ## Off by default, byte-identical when off
 *
 * No record is written unless the profile defines a surface ([resolveChildAssistant] returns
 * non-null) or the parent assistant has `enableSubAgentToolSurface` on ([SubAgentEngine]). With no
 * record, [apply] returns the **same `List<Tool>` instance** and [assistantFor] returns null, so an
 * install that configures neither sends exactly the tool schemas it sent before P2-04.

    /**
     * The assistant a sub-agent run's tool list should be assembled from, given its [profile].
     *
     * Returns `null` — "inherit the parent verbatim" — when there is nothing to override: no
     * profile at all, no parent assistant (a deleted parent), or a profile whose three surface
     * fields are all unset. That is the pre-P2-04 behaviour, and it is the answer for every profile
     * that only picks a model / system prompt (the overwhelmingly common case).
     *
     * When at least one field is set, the parent is copied with each field taken from the profile
     * when it has an opinion and from the parent otherwise:
     *
     *  - `localTools` — `null` inherits; otherwise the exact option groups the child gets.
     *  - `disabledLocalTools` — `null` inherits; otherwise the per-tool opt-out for the child.
     *  - `mcpServers` — `null` inherits; otherwise the MCP servers the child may use.
     *
     * The `id` is deliberately **not** changed: the child stays "the same assistant" for every
     * context-aware tool (`assistantId` in the invocation context, memory scoping, the recursion
     * guard). Only the tool surface is the child's own. (Per-agent namespaces are P2-06.)
