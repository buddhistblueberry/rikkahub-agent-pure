/**
 * T-09 / (8) + P2-04 — the headless **safety floor**: the per-tool predicate that decides
 * whether ANY sub-agent may be handed a tool.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A sub-agent is executed as a headless
 * [me.rerere.rikkahub.data.ai.tools.HeadlessConversations] run. Two things follow from that:
 *
 *  1. **Headless conversations auto-approve every tool.** `ChatService`'s `isToolAutoApproved`
 *     returns true for any conversation registered with `HeadlessConversations.mark()`, and that
 *     check does NOT consult [ToolApprovalDefaults.NO_ALWAYS_ALLOW]. So a sub-agent can call
 *     `eval_javascript`, `mcp_add`, `skill_install_from_url`, `keystore_generate_key`,
 *     `keystore_decrypt`, `grant_directory_access` or `nfc_write_tag` **unattended** — exactly the
 *     "confirm every single call, never blanket-allow" guarantee those tools are documented to
 *     have. That is a privilege-escalation hole, not a token-count nit: the parent may be
 *     prompt-injected, and the injected instruction now runs in a context that cannot ask the user
 *     anything.
 *  2. **A child can end up with a surface nobody chose for it.** The parent's `subagent_dispatch`
 *     `tools` allow-list used to be a dead parameter, and a sub-agent used to inherit its parent's
 *     COMPLETE surface (browser, NFC, external storage, workspace, skills, MCP, and the `subagent_*`
 *     handles themselves). The `subagent_*` tools are harmless only because three `isHeadless`
 *     checks refuse to act (the engine's recursion guard); they still cost tokens on every single
 *     request and invite the model to waste a whole tool trip discovering that dispatch is refused.
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 * [denialReason] is the floor: the one rule that is applied to every tool name that could reach a
 * sub-agent, wherever that name came from (the parent's surface, a dispatcher-supplied allow-list,
 * or — since P2-04 — a profile's OWN tool surface). It removes the tools a headless run must never
 * receive — see [UI_BOUND_TOOL_NAMES], [PRIVACY_SENSITIVE_TOOL_NAMES],
 * [ToolApprovalDefaults.NO_ALWAYS_ALLOW] and the `subagent_` prefix.
 *
 * This object is deliberately **pure policy, no state**. The per-conversation record of *which*
 * surface a run got (and the identity filter that applies this floor to the finished tool list each
 * time `ChatService` assembles one) lives in [SubAgentSurface].
 *
 * ## Grounded in code, not in guesswork
 *
 * Every set below is derived from something the app actually does (a `ToolHostActivity` host, an
 * `ALWAYS_ASK` registration, a prefix rule), so it cannot drift out of sync with the tool
 * implementations the way a hand-maintained "risky tools" list would.
