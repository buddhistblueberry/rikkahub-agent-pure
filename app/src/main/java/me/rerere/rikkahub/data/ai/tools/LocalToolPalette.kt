/**
 * P2-05 — the LOCAL producer for [ToolCatalog].
 *
 * The catalogue was built with two sources and only ever produced one: `ChatService` assembles
 * the MCP half of its progressive surface, and [ToolCatalogSource.LOCAL] sat declared but
 * unused. This is the producer for the local half, and its consumer is the **expert editor**,
 * not a chat turn — a searchable, browsable view of the local tool directory
 * (`LocalTools.getTools`), so configuring an expert's surface becomes a lookup instead of a
 * scroll through ~180 tool names.
 *
 * The chat paths are deliberately untouched. Nothing here can put a tool in front of a model:
 * the directory is only ever *read*, and whatever `ToolSurfaceResolver` assembles today it
 * still assembles, byte for byte.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * [LocalToolInventory] is what the caller supplies: one entry per [LocalToolOption] group,
 * carrying the tools the live factory returns for **that group alone**. Grouping is the
 * caller's job because only the caller can construct the factory; ranking is not, and is not
 * re-implemented here — [LocalToolPalette.search] delegates to the very same [ToolCatalog]
 * scorer `tool_search` uses (via [ToolCatalog.matchAll] / [ToolCatalog.search]), so a palette
 * hit and a model-facing hit can never disagree about what "most relevant" means.
 *
 * A name offered by two groups is attributed to the **first** one in inventory order: the row
 * has to point somewhere, and inventory order is the reading order of the group list the user
 * already knows.
 *
 * Pure: no Android, no coroutines, no `R`, no `Context`. `LocalToolPaletteTest` runs it on a
 * bare JVM.
