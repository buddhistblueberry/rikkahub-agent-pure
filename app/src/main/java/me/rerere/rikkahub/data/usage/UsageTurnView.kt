/**
 * P2-12b — the per-turn reading of the usage ledger.
 *
 * The per-message footer used to show `message.usage` only. That figure is produced by
 * `StreamChunkHandler` folding every call of a turn together with `TokenUsage.merge`, and that
 * merge overwrites each figure with the incoming non-zero value — so a turn that issued three
 * model calls displayed the numbers of its **last** call, not the sum (P2-11 defect A3). The
 * ledger records one row per round trip, so summing the rows that fall inside the turn's time
 * window is the first place a multi-call turn can actually be read.
 *
 * Attribution is by time window, exactly as agreed for P2-12:
 *
 *  - a node owns `[currentMessage.createdAt, nextNode.currentMessage.createdAt)`;
 *  - the last node's window is open-ended.
 *
 * The window deliberately ends at the *next* node rather than at `message.finishedAt`: a
 * streamed call writes its ledger row only once the flow completes, which is a few
 * milliseconds **after** the `Finish` chunk stamped `finishedAt` (P2-12a). A window closed at
 * `finishedAt` would therefore miss every streamed call — i.e. the whole default chat path.
 *
 * Two purposes are excluded by name — [UsagePurpose.TITLE] and [UsagePurpose.SUGGESTION].
 * Both fire right after a turn, reuse its conversation id and land in the same window, but
 * neither is part of the reply; without the filter every turn would be credited with one extra
 * title/suggestion call. Every other purpose is kept and labelled by the UI.
 *
 * Pure by construction: no Room runtime, no Android, no coroutines. [UsageRecordEntity] is a
 * plain data class — only its annotations need androidx.room on the compile classpath.
