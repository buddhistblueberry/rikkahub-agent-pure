/**
 * P2-01 — the ONE place a [ToolInvocationContext] gets its field values.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * Before P2-01 the same context was hand-assembled at every tool-assembly site (fast-path
 * router, rerun/regenerate, the normal chat turn, workflow fire, cron direct mode). Each site
 * picked its own subset of the six fields, so a semantic change — T-04's
 * `subAgentContextRefsEnabled`, T-09's `subAgentToolSurfaceEnabled`, the `modelCanSeeImages`
 * fix for `show_image` — had to be applied in five places or the surfaces silently drifted
 * apart. That is exactly the "路径漂移" this refactor removes.
 *
 * The functions below take plain values (no `Assistant` / `Model` dependency) so the field
 * choices are unit-testable on a bare JVM; [me.rerere.rikkahub.data.ai.ToolSurfaceResolver]
 * holds the `Assistant`-flavoured wrappers that call sites actually use.
 *
 * ## The three shapes, and why they differ
 *
 *  - [chat] — an interactive turn, *including* its tool-loop continuation and its rerun
 *    ("regenerate") rebuild. The model is about to be handed these schemas, so every
 *    model-derived flag is set: `modelCanSeeImages` and both sub-agent schema gates.
 *  - [fastPath] — the Phase 16 fast-path router. Its tools are **executed, never shown to a
 *    model** (the router matches an intent and calls the tool directly), so there is no model
 *    to inform and no schema to gate; only the freeze flag is passed through, so that if the
 *    router ever runs against a conversation whose sub-agent surface is frozen it resolves
 *    the same tools the model was offered.
 *  - [headless] — workflow fire / cron direct mode. There is no conversation and no model:
 *    only the calling assistant id and the headless bit (which fires the sub-agent recursion
 *    guard) are known.
 *
 * Callers with no context at all (the legacy [me.rerere.rikkahub.data.ai.tools.LocalTools]
 * `getTools(options)` shape) must pass [ToolInvocationContext.EMPTY] explicitly rather than
 * inventing a new literal here.
